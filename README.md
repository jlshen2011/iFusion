# *i*Fusion: Individualized Fusion Learning

## Introduction

iFusion is a general statistical framework for making targeted inference and prediction.

This package implements my 2019 JASA paper - *i*Fusion: Individualized Fusion Learning. While the methodology in my original paper focuses on making individualized statistical **inference** (that is, parameter estimation, confidence interval/region, hypothesis testing, etc.), the package simplifies the methods with an emphasis on **prediction**.
